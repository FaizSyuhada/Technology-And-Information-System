## Project: All-In-One Medical App | HealthSphere App
**Task:** Design Thinking Project 

⚡ **Fun Fact: How We Got the Idea** 
At first, I wanted to develop a Warehouse Management System (WMS) since it aligned with my logistics background. But after thinking for a bit, I realized that if we went that route, my team would just be programmers following orders, much like working for a company. I didn’t want that. I wanted them to experience why and how we build an app, not just what to build.

So, I challenged them:

    "Can you guys brainstorm what app we actually need in real life? Focus on the problem."
    "Since some of you are from Indonesia, we probably share common issues. I want something more interesting."

That’s when Shima suggested a Smart Medicine Inventory Management System—a system for tracking stock levels, managing expiration dates, and sending alerts to ensure medicines are always available. Hilmi took it further, suggesting patient-side integration, making it more than just an inventory system.

We didn’t want to limit it to just a single function, so instead of focusing only on inventory or prescriptions, we built something bigger—an all-in-one medical app. After a discussion on what to call it, HealthSphere was born—a platform combining Patient Relationship Management (PRM), Electronic Medical Records (EMRS), and personal medication tracking into one system.

Instead of just making what I said, my team got to experience the thought process of solving real-world problems, making the project more meaningful.
